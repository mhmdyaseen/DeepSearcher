       "\n",
       "## Introduction\n",
       "Quantum computing is a cutting-edge field that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations in ways that classical computers cannot. By leveraging phenomena like superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to solve complex problems across various industries, from medicine to materials science. While still in its early stages, quantum computing is rapidly evolving, attracting significant investment and sparking intense research efforts worldwide. This article explores the fundamentals of quantum computing, its potential applications, the challenges it faces, and the exciting developments on the horizon.\n",
       "\n",
       "## What is Quantum Computing?\n",
       "- Quantum computing exploits the unique properties of quantum mechanics, such as **superposition** and **entanglement**, to process information. \n",
       "- Unlike classical computers that use bits representing 0 or 1, quantum computers use **qubits**, which can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. \n",
       "- This allows quantum computers to perform calculations in a fundamentally different way, potentially solving problems that are intractable for classical computers. <sub>[1]</sub>\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Concepts in Quantum Computing\n",
       "1.  **Qubit (Quantum Bit)**:\n",
       "    - The basic unit of information in quantum computing. \n",
       "    - Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in a superposition of states, representing 0, 1, or any combination thereof. \n",
       "    - This is often visualized using the **Bloch sphere**, where the state of a qubit is represented as a point on the sphere's surface. \n",
       "      ```html\n",
       "      <img src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Bloch_sphere.svg/220px-Bloch_sphere.svg.png\" alt=\"Bloch Sphere representation of a qubit\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" />\n",
       "      ```\n",
       "      <sub>[2]</sub>\n",
       "2.  **Superposition**:\n",
       "    - The ability of a qubit to be in multiple states (0 and 1) at the same time. \n",
       "    - This allows quantum computers to explore many possibilities simultaneously, greatly enhancing their computational power. \n",
       "    - Superposition is achieved by manipulating qubits using precision lasers or microwave beams. <sub>[3]</sub>\n",
       "3.  **Entanglement**:\n",
       "    - A phenomenon where two or more qubits become linked, and the state of one qubit instantaneously affects the state of the others, regardless of the distance separating them. \n",
       "    - Entanglement allows quantum computers to perform calculations in a coordinated and efficient manner. \n",
       "    - This \"spooky action at a distance,\" as Einstein called it, is key to the power of quantum computers. <sub>[3]</sub>\n",
       "\n",
       "## History and Development\n",
       "- The idea of quantum computing emerged from the difficulty of simulating quantum systems using classical computers. \n",
